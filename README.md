1. Number of occurrences of a specific Wifi By names : Wifi named “Hostel” is used more frequent times, this can be used to analyze the usage of wifi in
the specific areas. The count of Hostel is highest as students uses more wifi in their hostel.

3. 2. Occurrences of IP-Addresses : IP-Address “10.200.0.222” has been used most of the times.We can interpret that this IP-Address
and Hostel has a relation between them.

4. Number of times Wifi-id is used on daily basis : For some day, the plot is missing, this indicates that student does not use any wifi
for few days in the college. It must be because they were not present in the campus that time.
